        -Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices of all shapes, and projects of all sizes.
        Bootstrap ships with vanilla CSS, but its source code utilizes the two most popular CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass. Quickly get started with precompiled CSS or build on the source.
        Bootstrap easily and efficiently scales your websites and applications with a single code base, from phones to tablets to desktops with CSS media queries.
        With Bootstrap, you get extensive and beautiful documentation for common HTML elements, dozens of custom HTML and CSS components, and awesome jQuery plugins.
        -HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
        HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like <html>).
        HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides
        a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It can embed
        scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages.
        -CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used
        to style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is a
        cornerstone specification of the web, and almost all web pages use CSS style sheets to describe their presentation.
